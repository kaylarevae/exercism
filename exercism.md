# Hello World! 

**Gradle** Tool used to compile and test code

## Misc and practice
- Access settings in IntelliJ with keyboard shortcut 'Command + ,'
- Clear the terminal window with the command " clear "
- Used Homebrew to install Exercism locally through the command line

## Solutions found
- Needed to use Java 17 to work with Gradle through Exercism

## Reflections
The challenge of this project was getting the right versions of Java and Gradle. I learned command line prompts to simplify my workflow and used settings of IntelliJ I have not encountered before.
